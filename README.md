# Hi, i am Andre 😁

I've been working as PHP software developer since some years, and i've been learning a lot from it.🌱🐘 My purpose here is to contribute to the developers community, deploying simple code examples, simple projects and perhaps contribute to some projects too. 

At my free times, i've been studying and applying new software development subjects like Sofware Engineering, Php news features, Python, Data Structure, Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence and others. I am a big supporter of Free Software projects too. 🐧
